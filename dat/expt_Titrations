Experiment 8 Synthetic vs Natural Indicators~- Standardize a titrant of unknown concentration
- Differentiate between different indicators
- Given a titration of a specific pH
range, determine the best indicator~Part A  Standardization of the NaOH Solution

Obtain about 200 mL of 0.1 M NaOH(aq). This solution must be standardized before it is used in the analysis of the unknown acid sample. Rinse the buret with this solution, and then fill the buret with the 0.1 M NaOH(aq).  Make sure all air bubbles are eliminated from the buret tip.

Drain solution out of the buret until the liquid level is below the zero mark and then record the initial volume of the NaOH(aq) solution. Remember to read the buret at the bottom of the meniscus and to estimate and record each buret reading to the nearest 0.01 mL. Ask the lab instructor or lab assistant if you have trouble reading the buret.

Weigh approximately 0.350 grams of KHP into either a 250 or 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Record the mass of KHP in your lab notebook to as many decimal places as the balance provides. Add 50 mL of deionized water to dissolve the KHP. Also add two drops of phenolphthalein indicator.   Swirl the flask until all of the solid KHP dissolves.

Slowly add the NaOH(aq) solution from the buret to the Erlenmeyer flask containing the dissolved KHP(aq) and indicator. Swirl the flask after each addition. Initially add the NaOH from the buret in 1-2 mL increments. As the endpoint nears, the indicator color appears and then fades slowly. The closer to the end point, the more slowly the indicator fades. When this occurs, begin to add the NaOH(aq) in smaller volume increments.

Continue to titrate the KHP(aq) sample with NaOH(aq) until the endpoint of the titration is reached. At the endpoint, one drop of NaOH(aq) turns the KHP(aq) solution a pale pink color that persists  for at least 30 seconds.  At the endpoint, you should still be able to see through the solution.

Read and record in your notebook the final volume of NaOH(aq) in the buret and subtract from this reading the volume from step 1. This difference is the volume of base needed to neutralize all the KHP(aq) solution in the Erlenmeyer flask.

Refill the buret and repeat the titration twice with new samples of KHP(s). The mass of KHP(s) must be known in each titration, but the masses of KHP used need not be exactly the same all trials. Before continuing the experiment, have the instructor check the precision of the titration results.  A fourth trial may be necessary if one measurement is very different than the others.

Calculate the concentration of the NaOH(aq) solution for each titration performed, and then determine the average NaOH(aq) concentration for the standardization procedure. An example calculation is shown on page 6.~- 1 buret and stopcock
